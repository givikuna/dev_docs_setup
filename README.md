# dev_docs_setup
setup for the working folder for a computer. can be used for most distros (preferably NixOS or Ubuntu, or just something Debian based). NOTE: this'll install a bunch of dependencies and stuff you might not want to have installed, read the files and change them before you use it (you can also use the CLI UI to easily manage this)
